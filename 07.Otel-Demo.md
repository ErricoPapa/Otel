# 07- OpenTelemetry Full Demo implemetation 
### Deploy Demo

Add OpenTelemetry Helm repository:

```sh
helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
```
 
To install the chart with the release name `my-otel-demo`, run the following command:

```sh
helm install my-otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo
```

**Note:** The OpenTelemetry Demo Helm chart version 0.11.0 or greater is required to perform all usage methods mentioned below.

## Post-Deploy Steps Demo

The demo application will need the services exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster in order to use them. You can expose the services to your local system using the `kubectl port-forward` command or by configuring service types (i.e., LoadBalancer) with optionally deployed ingress resources.

### Expose Services Using kubectl port-forward

To expose the `frontendproxy` service, use the following command (replace `my-otel-demo` with your Helm chart release name accordingly):

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/my-otel-demo-frontendproxy 8080:8080
```

**Note:** `kubectl port-forward` will proxy the port until the process terminates. You may need to create separate terminal sessions for each use of `kubectl port-forward`, and use `Ctrl-C` to terminate the process when done.

With the `frontendproxy` port-forward set up, you can access:

- Web store: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- Grafana: [http://localhost:8080/grafana/](http://localhost:8080/grafana/)
- Load Generator UI: [http://localhost:8080/loadgen/](http://localhost:8080/loadgen/)
- Jaeger UI: [http://localhost:8080/jaeger/ui/](http://localhost:8080/jaeger/ui/)

In order for spans from the Web store to be collected, you must expose the OpenTelemetry Collector OTLP/HTTP receiver:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/my-otel-demo-otelcol 4318:4318
```
